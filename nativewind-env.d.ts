///<reference types ="nativewind/types" />

/*
-> This is TypeScript syntax that tells TypeScript compiler to include or load the types from the
nativewind/types.

-> nativewind is a library that brings Tailwind CSS-style utility classes to React Native.

-> It's like using className="bg-red-500 p-4" in React Native components instead of StyleSheet.create().

-> with the help of this reference, nativewind modifies React Native components (View, Text, etc.)
 to accept className and understand it.

 -> It prevents TypeScript errors when using NativeWind utilities.
