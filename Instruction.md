 Step to set up: 
- Download and Install VSCode

- Download and Install Node.Js(which comes with npm) 
-> Node.js is required for React Native CLI, and npm helps you manage dependencies like React Native itself.

-   Install Expo CLI (Optional but Recommended for Beginners) 
-> Expo simplifies setting up React Native, and you can easily test your app on your phone using the Expo Go app. Itâ€™s a great way to start without needing to deal with the full React Native environment setup right away. Type: npm install -g expo-cli

- Create an app by typing in terminal in VsCode - npx create-expo-app MyProject

- then, cd MyProject (Directoty change to MyProject)

- npx expo start
